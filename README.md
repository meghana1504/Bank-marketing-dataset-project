## Bank-marketing-dataset-project

Our Data Set Contains Information Of 41188 People Out Of Which Only 4640 Have Subscribed To The Offer given by the bank Which Is Around ONLY 10 % </br>
So, we should be able to predict which class of people is accepting the offer given by the bank and which class does not.</br>
So We Are Trying To Investigate And Seperate Out That Class Of People Which Is Accepting The Offer using various ML algorithms.</br>

### Algorithms used:
1) Logistic Regression </br>
2) Support Vector Machine </br>
3) Random Forest Classifier </br>
4) Naive Bayes </br>
5) Stochastic Gradient Descend </br>
6) K Neighbours Classifier </br>
7) MLP Classifier </br>
